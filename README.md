<h2 id="quick-start">üèÉ Quick Start üí®</h2>

Add the library to your Android project, then check out the examples below!

### Gradle Setup

```gradle-setup
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.HuveD:AutoTouchManager:1.0.0'
}
```

<h2 id="simple-usage">‚å®Ô∏è Simple Usage üñ≤</h2>

#### Just setting and play. Very Simple!

```
// Create the Auto touch List.
// The events below occur sequentially.
ArrayList<TouchData> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add(new TouchData(wantX, wantY));
list.add(new TouchData(wantXAfterTouch1, wantYAfterTouch1));

// Start the auto touch.
AutoTouchManager.getInstance().setTouchEventPreset(list);
AutoTouchManager.getInstance().play(this);
```

<br/>

#### (Optional) Attach the finish event listener

```
// Create a 'OnFinishListener'
AutoTouchManager.OnFinishListener onFinishListener = new AutoTouchManager.OnFinishListener() {
	@Override
	public void onFinish() {
		// This method will be invoked after the 'auto touch' finished.
	}
};

// Set the listener
AutoTouchManager.getInstance().setOnFinishListener(onFinishListener);
```

<br/>

#### (Optional) Attach the error event listener

```
// Create a 'OnErrorListener'
AutoTouchManager.OnErrorListener onErrorListener = new AutoTouchManager.OnErrorListener() {
	@Override
	public void onError(String message) {
		Log.d("Your Tag", "Error occurred: " + message);
	}
};

// Set the listener
AutoTouchManager.getInstance().setOnErrorListener(onErrorListener);
```

##### 1. TouchData(float, float)  
##### 1st params  
- The x coordinate of screen anticipated occurring the touch.  
##### 2nd params  
- The y coordinate of screen anticipated occurring the touch.

<br>

##### 2. TouchData(float, float, int)

- The x coordinate of screen anticipated occurring the touch.  
##### 2nd params  
- The y coordinate of screen anticipated occurring the touch.  
##### 3rd params  
- The delay time until the touch occurred. For example, if you set the time at 3000, the Auto touch will occur after 3 seconds.
